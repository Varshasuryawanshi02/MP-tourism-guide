    <h2>HALALI</h2>
    <p><b>Overview :</b>Puranic name of Amarkantak was Riksha parvat.

Legend has it that Lord Shiva blessed Narmada with unique purifying powers. Whereas to purify himself, a devotee requires taking one dip in the Holy Ganga, seven days' prayers on the banks of Yamuna and three days prayers on the banks of Saraswati, the mere sight of Narmada is enough. A charming folk tale describes the superiority of Narmada over Ganga. Once every year, after she herself is polluted beyond tolerance, Ganga visits Narmada dressed like a dark woman and takes a cleansing purifying dip in its waters! Narmada, which is more than 150 million years older than the Ganges RiverGanga and is considered by many Hindus to be the most sacred for all the rivers of India, Amarkantak itself is sacred to the Hindus and is deemed to be a door-way to 'nirwana'.<br/><br/><b>How To Reach :</b>Reaching Amarkantak by Air :- The nearest airport to Amarkantak is at Jabalpur, which is 245 km away from City of Amarkantak.

    <p><b>Overview :</b>There's a difference between a good destination and a great one! The good might please you temporarily, relax your nerves and ensnare you by impeccable hospitality & heart warming views. But the great asks for passion, risk and sweat, only then it unveils itself and when it doesâ€¦you get stunned. You think. You wonder! Kawadiya Mountain is one-of-its-kind site that charms you with the breathtaking view of countless pillar-like stones. Rare, exotic and innumerable! The stones are 12 feet long, 2 feet wide and mainly hexagonal in shape. Piled up in a certain array, they form a trail of one kilometre. The stones produce sound when you beat on them and each stone makes a different sound. The local people claim to hear soft, ringing sounds from stones on certain nights.Folklore insists when Bheem wished to marry river goddess Narmada, she chided him to stop her flow by the next dawn using his valor. Only then she would submit to his wishes. Bheem procured these stones but failed to reach the river. There's reportedly no other place in the world like this. Quiet, virgin and untouched, Kawadiya Hill indisputably tops the 'unsung' must-see sights.<br/><br/><b>How To Reach :</b>Kawadiya is 120 kms from Indore.
